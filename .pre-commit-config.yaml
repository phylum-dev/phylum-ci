# This is the config for using `pre-commit` on this repository.
#
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
#
# NOTE: Individual hook revisions are kept up to date automatically with the `auto_updates` workflow, which
#       bumps hooks to the latest tag. That workflow manually specifies every repository except for `poetry`
#       since it sometimes specifies the most recent tag on a stable version branch instead of the default branch.
# NOTE: New repos added here should also be added to the `auto_updates` workflow.
