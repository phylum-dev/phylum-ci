## Future Integrations

If there is an unsupported use case for managing the security of your dependencies, we want to know about it.
If there is a way Phylum can be used to make your life as a developer easier, we want to be there for you and do it!

Please let us know what you need by either creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/phylum-dev/phylum-ci/issues)
or sending a note through the general [Contact Us](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/support) options.
