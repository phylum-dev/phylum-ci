# Security Policy

Phylum was founded by a team of security researchers at heart, and we take the security of our tooling seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We love coordinated disclosure!
Please email [security@phylum.io](mailto:security@phylum.io) to start a conversation!
We'll coordinate a secure communication mechanism first, then evaluate the reported issue(s)
and keep you apprised each step of the way.

## Supported Versions

The project currently makes use of a [zero-based versioning scheme](https://0ver.org/) and will continue to do so until
it is deemed stable. Until then, only the latest release of the project is supported with security updates. That is, if
changes are made to adhere to security, a new release containing those changes will be made from the latest commits to
the default branch. No long-living release branches will be created. This policy may change once there are non-zero
major version releases.
