# Security Policy

At Veracode, security is job number one. We consider security in everything we
do to ensure the trustworthiness of the tools and services we provide.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We love coordinated disclosure!
Please email [grc@veracode.com](mailto:grc@veracode.com) to start a conversation!
We'll coordinate a secure communication mechanism first, then evaluate the
reported issue(s) and keep you apprised each step of the way.

## Supported Versions

The project currently makes use of a [zero-based versioning scheme](https://0ver.org/) and will continue to do so until
it is deemed stable. Until then, only the latest release of the project is supported with security updates. That is, if
changes are made to adhere to security, a new release containing those changes will be made from the latest commits to
the default branch. No long-living release branches will be created. This policy may change once there are non-zero
major version releases.
