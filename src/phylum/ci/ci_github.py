A GitHub token with API access is required to use the API (e.g., to post comments).
This can be the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided automatically at the start of each workflow run.
It can also be either a classic or fine-grained personal access token (PAT).
A `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs at least write access for `pull-requests` scope (even though the `issues` API is used).
A classic PAT needs the `repo` scope or minimally the `public_repo` scope if private repositories are not used.
A fine-grained PAT needs read access to `metadata` and read/write access to `pull requests`.
