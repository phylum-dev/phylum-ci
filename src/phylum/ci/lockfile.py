"""Define a lockfile implementation.

A Phylum project can consist of multiple lockfiles.
This module/class represents a single lockfile.

For historical purposes, this module uses "lockfile" language instead of the
more general "dependency file" term. Both lockfiles and manifests are supported
and the language has been changed where it is externally visible (e.g., log and
help output) but kept as "lockfile" internally (e.g., code/variable names).
