# The full list of markdown styles, as of the time of this writing, is included here to make it easier to understand
# what can be modified. The default styles are also included so any future changes will not cause unexpected output.
# The colors chosen are from the standard 8-bit colors supported in terminals and are close to the range of blue colors
# that make up the Phylum logo. These colors are also able to be represented by a name instead of a hex or RGB value.
